 Since this was the first ever website I built, it was very challenging.
 Especially ensuring that my site was mobile friendly did not come easy. I read a number of blogs, watched many 
 youtube videos and most improtantly googled stuffs until i found solutions. In general, the entire experience was a learning journery for me and I look forward to  improving the site as I gain more experience. 

Building this site improved my skills on how to better layout websites with HTML 5 tags.
In addition, I learnt so much about CSS Grid and FlexBox.

I suggest that anyone trying to also build a portfolio site should try and keep it simple as possible. This implies making sure that your page visitors do not find it difficult to navigate through your page.
Your portfolio should only include the most relevant information.

Moreover, make sure to choose the right colors and font-sizes for your site, this is very important.
